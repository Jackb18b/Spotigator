# Spotigator
To make this program be able to read the required data, you must first create a directory under the Spotigator directory called "Data" such that the file path is "Spotigator/Data/".
Then, you will need to download a .csv file that we will supply you with under the Administrative section of our report. Place this file in the folder you just made.
If everything is correct, the file location should be named "Spotigator/Data/universal_top_spotify_songs.csv". The program should now be able to execute properly.
MinGW is required to run this program.
