# Spotigator
To make this program be able to read the required data, you must first create a directory under the Spotigator directory called "Data" such that the file path is "Spotigator/Data/".
Then, you will need to download a .csv file that we will supply you with and place it in the folder you just made. The program should now be able to execute properly.
